Behrens Antiqua Initialen by Typo-Graf

Behrens Antiqua Initialen.ttf

The original font designer of Behrens Antiqua Initialen is Peter Behrens (1868-1940). To my knowledge and research there is no computer version of this font available. I scanned and digitised it from type specimen sheets of various quality. Some letters like O and U lack refinement. The font is public domain, free for all uses, commercial and private.
